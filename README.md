1.> Farm App
Uses canny filter for edge detection in real time drone image captures of farmland and then assigns them their record in a binary search tree to be accessed by the user and then uses traversal to plot canal paths to each field utilizing the most effecient path selection.

2.>PICR
Uses a threshold value for pixel intensity in RGB planes respectively and checks for best gradients equating to sharper contrast in similar images.

3.>PICR_ML
Advancement on previous project includes a neural net to figure best picture qualities from the user's gallery and then filter the best suited images from recent pictures sharing the same temporal setting .
